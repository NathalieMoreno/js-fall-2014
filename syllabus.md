#### Books & Resources

There are a lot of great Javascript resource, but no required purchases for this course. I’ll be assigning required readings from the web to supplement the class work. We’ll be using Eloquent Javascript for many of the readings. It’s free online, but also available in print if you like to have a physical book.

For those seeking more:

If you feel like you have less programming experience than the rest of the class, the tutorials on codeacademy.com might be helpful for you. We’re going to move fast, so this is a great resource for some extra help.

In addition, I strongly recommend that you check out the following websites, or at least know their existence, as they can prove immensely useful when you need them. More topic-specific resources will be shared in class.
