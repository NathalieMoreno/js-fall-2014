Exercise
=========

To complete these exercises, use the wk3 homework template in your repo.

- Make a loop that console.logs the numbers 1 - 1000
- Ask the user a yes-no question using `prompt`. Store the answer in a variable.
- Write an if...then statement so that if you user input 'yes' the program adds the class 'yes' to the body of the page, or adds the class 'no' if the user enters 'no'. Add some css so the page background changes based on the class.

Do one of the following:

- Math.rand() gives you a random number from 0-1. Write a program that prompts the user for a number then loops a random number of times between 0 and the user's number printing . For instance, if the user enters 37, the program might log up to 15, 33, 11, but definitely not 38, 50 or 99.
- Do the [FizzBuzz](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#p_i0Cvwf75cQ) problem from the reading.
