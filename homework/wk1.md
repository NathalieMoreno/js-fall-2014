This is your first assignment, and its very important.
It's the basis for all the other assignments. Each week, you'll be submitting work
by uploading it to a website called Github.com. Github is a popular site used by programmers to 
colloborate on code. It's based on Git, a piece of __version control software__. 

If you don't know what that is, that's ok. You know when you're working on a Photoshop file and you want to make a new copy, but you
think you might still want to keep around your old changes, so you save as and name it something like _final-project-new-2-jan-11th.psd_? Programmers don't like to that.
It gets to confusing to figure out what the actual new version is. So we use a version control tool to keep around all the old versions. They're tucked away, out of site, but available. Git is one of these tools.

Git can be pretty daunting even to seasoned professionals. But our use will be pretty basic. Before you get started, here are some terms:

#### Glossary

##### Repository (Repo):
A single git project. Can have multiple folders and files. Can exist on many computer. There is a copy of the repo for this class at https://github.com/miniatureape/js-fall-2014. I also have a local copy on my computer. You can clone it yourself and have your own copy. when you do, you have the complete project history.

##### Adding:
In order for git to track a project, you have to 'add' it to the repo. Otherwise it will ignore it.

##### Commit:
A change or set of changes you've made to one or more files.

##### Pushing:
To move the code from your computer where you're working to a central repo to share with others, you 'push' your code.

#### Example workflow.

You have a new project you're about to start. First you create a git repo to track files. Then you create a file, _index.html_. You're ready to save this work, so you add this file to the repo and commit file. You also want to share it with the world, so you push it to your remote repo. 

You decide there are a few changes you'd like to make so you edit your file. When you have completed the edits, you commit again. Then you decide you need a new file _main.css_ so you create it and add it to the repo. Now you want to share this new file and all your changes so you push again.


Your assignment for this week:

1. Create an account on github.com (a free one is just fine).
2. Download a client for your [Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [PC](https://windows.github.com/).
3. Complete steps 1-6 in the getting started guide for [Mac](https://mac.github.com/help.html) or 1-4 in the guide for [PC](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows) 
4. Create a local repository with a single file and push it github.com.

Note: the window instructions are much worse. I suggest you follow the Mac instructions even if you're on a windows machine, but understand you'll have to do a bit of translation, because the user interfaces are not identical. If you're having trouble see also:

- https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository
- https://help.github.com/articles/adding-repositories-with-github-for-windows

If you're not afraid of your computer's terminal, skipping the github GUI is fine. You can work on the command line if you wish.

I know this is a lot to take in without any instruction, but remember, you have two weeks to complete this because we don't meet the first two Mondays. If you're having trouble, reach out to your fellow students, the internet at large or me. You will have completed this assignment if:

- You have a github account
- You have a local repository (doesn't matter what's in it).
- You have pushed the local repository to github.
